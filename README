Swfdec is a decoder/renderer for Macromedia Flash animations. The decoding and 
rendering engine is provided in a library that can be used by other 
applications.  

An additional library named libswfdec-gtk is provided for easy integration of
Swfdec into Gtk applications. This library is what developers most likely want 
to target their applications at. Building this library can be disabled.

The library is still in heavy development. The intended audience are developers
or people using it for pretested Flash animations (think embedded here). If you
use it on unknown content, expect it to have issues and don't be surprised if 
it crashes. If you encounter such a crash however, make sure to file a bug 
immediately.

Swfdec contains some applications for testing and debugging the library. These 
are available in the player/ and test/ directory. They are not installed. The
applications in the player/ directory require GTK and ALSO to build, while the
library does not. So if you are packaging Swfdec, you probably do not want to 
make it depend on GTK or ALSA.

The test/ directory contains subdirectories that run automated tests with the 
provided SWF files in the directory. See the README files in those directories
for details on how to run or add these tests.

If you want to playing Flash files in your web browser, you need a browser 
plugin additional to this library. The plugins are shipped in separate 
packages, like swfdec-mozilla. You can get them at the same location as swfdec.

Limitations:

 - A few rare object types are not handled at all. They are ignored.

 - SWF files that use Flash generally heavily depend on ActionScript features.
   Support for ActionScript is currently incomplete. Unsupported scripts are
   skipped.

 - If any known unsupported behaviour is encountered, Swfdec will print a 
   notice to stderr and try to interpret the file nonetheless. If you 
   encounter a file with only some unsupported things, it may be a good idea
   to open a feature request bug and provide the file. The developers are
   always interested in files that motivate them to do little steps.
