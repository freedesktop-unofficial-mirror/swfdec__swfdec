/**
 * SECTION:SwfdecBuffer
 * @title: SwfdecBuffer
 * @short_description: memory region handling
 *
 * This section describes how memory is to be handled when interacting with the 
 * Swfdec library. Memory regions are refcounted and passed using a 
 * #SwfdecBuffer. If large memory segments need to be handled that may span
 * multiple buffers, Swfdec uses a #SwfdecBufferQueue.
 */

/*** SwfdecBuffer ***/

/**
 * SwfdecBuffer:
 * @data: the data. read-only
 * @length: number of bytes in @data. read-only
 *
 * To allow for easy sharing of memory regions, #SwfdecBuffer was created. 
 * Every buffer refers to a memory region and its size and takes care of 
 * freeing that region when the buffer is no longer needed. They are 
 * reference countedto make it easy to refer to the same region from various
 * independant parts of your code. Buffers also support some advanced 
 * functionalities like extracting parts of the buffer using 
 * swfdec_buffer_new_subbuffer() or using mmapped files with 
 * swfdec_buffer_new_from_file() without the need for a different API.
 */

/**
 * SwfdecBufferFreeFunc:
 * @data: The data to free
 * @priv: The private data registered for passing to this function
 *
 * This is the function prototype for the function that is called for freeing
 * the memory pointed to by a buffer. See swfdec_buffer_new() for an example.
